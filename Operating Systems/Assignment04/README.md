# ASSIGNMENT04 - Specifications
__________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a program to compare the performance of the LRU and the Optimal page replacement algorithms.  The program will take a reference string and the number of frames as inputs.
Assume the maximum length of a reference string is 20 and there are 5 different pages from page 1 to page 5.  The reference string can be randomly generated and the number of
frames is entered through the keyboard.  For example, the system gererates a reference string 2 1 3 4 5 2 3 ... 5 and you enter the number of frames 3.  Compare the number of
page faults generated by the Optimal and LRU algorithms.  Print out the page replacement process and you can see how LRU differs from the optimal.

### Running the program:

```
~$ gcc -o run lab04.c
``` 
```
~$ ./run
``` 
### Sample output:

```
Enter number of pages: 3

contents of referenceStr: 5  3  4  1  4  2  2  5  4  4  3  2  5  4  1  5  2  1  1  5

pg: 1 | 2  4  1  | HIT
pg: 5 | 2  4  1  | MISS
----------------
final page stack: 2  5  1  

===Optimal Algorithm===

pg: 2 | 5  2  1  | HIT
pg: 1 | 5  2  1  | HIT
pg: 1 | 5  2  1  | HIT
pg: 5 | 5  2  1  | HIT
----------------
final page stack: 5  2  1  

lruResults:  Hit = 6, Miss = 14
optResults:  Hit = 12, Miss = 8
LRU:Optimal hit ratio: 0.50
Optimal ran 50.00 percent more efficient than LRU.
